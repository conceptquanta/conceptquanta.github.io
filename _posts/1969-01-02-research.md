# Research

Currently, the CQ Research Group is in very early experiments with new projects. We can only list the code names and a very unclear descriptions of each project.

## Current Projects

* **"Run Sam Run"**: Aerosplice inspired puzzler
* **"Green"**: Sustainability will not die of dysentery

As more experiments are analyzed, more information will become available to the public.

# Prior Research

The CQ Research Group endeavors to learn a significant amount from its research. This page breifly describes each of Concept Quanta's projects with links to additional resources so the public can learn from our research, as well.
